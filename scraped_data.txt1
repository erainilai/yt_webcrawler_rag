# LangChain overview

LangChain is an open source framework with a pre-built agent architecture and integrations for any model or tool — so you can build agents that adapt as fast as the ecosystem evolves

##

​

Create an agent

` # pip install -qU langchain "langchain[anthropic]" from langchain.agents import create_agent def get_weather ( city : str ) -> str : """Get weather for a given city.""" return f "It's always sunny in { city } !" agent = create_agent( model = "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929" , tools = [get_weather], system_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant" , ) # Run the agent agent.invoke( { "messages" : [{ "role" : "user" , "content" : "what is the weather in sf" }]} ) `

##

​

Core benefits

## Standard model interface

## Easy to use, highly flexible agent

## Built on top of LangGraph

## Debug with LangSmith
